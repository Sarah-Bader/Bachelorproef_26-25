Companies not only use the mainframe for “legacy” applications, but are also developing new ap- plications for mainframes, resulting in a rise in mainframe sales. These increases, along with an aging mainframe work- force and academia’s move away from mainframe-related curricula and courses, has resulted in a shortage of workers trained in mainframe applications. In this paper we report on a U.S.-based survey of industry and academia that con-firms the existence of this problem. We conclude with some possible future research directions to explore as possible so- lutions to this potential dilemma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;},

      abstract = {It is widely accepted that the instruction of programming in assembly language is often a challenging and frustrating experience both to educators and undergraduate students. It is crucial to make sure that frustration does not compel students to abandon the subject. This can be addressed by enhancing delivery through various mechanisms such as employing game development, fun activities, and powerful visualizations. In this study, we take a step back trying to understand which topics pose challenges to students more than others. We analyzed six different submissions for 244 students to answer this question. These six submissions include five term assignments and one project in one semester.},
